CLUEDO

COMMON ROOM:
•	Dinner is served
•	Lord Tietgen holds his speech
•	Clementine tells Lady Tietgen that somebody have stolen Flemming which Lady Tietgen will tell everyone else about
•	Rued Langgaard will then say that he heard the noise come from the common room (where Silvia was)
•	Players go to common room and finds the CD that Gladys Tietgen heard the night before
•	On the back-side of this CD there is a USB-stick which they need to plug into a computer (remember to call the folder “SRO 2013”)
•	Sir Daniel Phillip knows that this is Gladys Tietgen who has her personal stuff in such folder
•	Clementine knows that Gladys Tietgen uses the code for her personal stuff which is the amount of episodes she has seen EX ON THE BEACH
•	The doctor knows that Gladys Tietgen has seen 696969 episodes of EX ON THE BEACH. The folder includes a video which reveales that Flemming has been stolen. The hint from the video is, that since Flemming is very heavy, the person who did this must have been very strong, which could help us get on the track of whom it might be.

FITNESS ROOM:
•	They go to look for clues in the fitness room and someone will get iced. With the ice is there a piece of paper asking people to go clean the dishes and eat dessert

AFTER DESSERT / ALIBABA ROOM:
•	We will get someone to call the phone in the kitchen who says that he/she has gotten a clue that the person who stole Flemming has been trying to exchange it away på tietgens fysiske bazar.
•	Players should then go to the Alibaba room where they will find something that needs to be drunk. On the bottom of that it will have a clue.
•	The clue says that the players should look where the Nutella is

KITCHEN:
•	“Home is where the Nutella is” is on the bars in the kitchen, where we will put the letters that together form GO ASK ANNE SOPHIE
•	The players will then head to 12.2 where Annso will hand them a forbrugskort that can be used for printing but that she does not know what the code for it is, other than it was something that was always in the back of C.F. Tietgens mind

CIRCLE:
•	The players will then move to the circle to the byste where they will find the code written on the back of Tietgens head

PRINTER:
•	The players will then move to the printer and print out a picture of me and Emil and a boat

OUTSIDE AT THE CHANAL:
•	The players will meet us (should we be dressed up?) and told that they are very close to solve the mystery but first they should come up with a punishment for the one who stole Flemming (should we come up with alternatives?). Then they have to sail out and get the clues we have hidden in the kanal (with balloons showing where they are)
